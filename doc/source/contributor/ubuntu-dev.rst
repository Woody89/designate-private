*********************************
Development Environment on Ubuntu
*********************************

Designate is comprised of four main components :ref:`designate-api`, :ref:`designate-central`,
designate-mdns, and designate-pool-manager, supported by a few
standard open source components. For more information see :ref:`architecture`.

There are many different options for customizing Designate, and two of these options
have a major impact on the installation process:

* The storage backend used (SQLite or MySQL)
* The DNS backend used (PowerDNS or BIND9)

This guide will walk you through setting up a typical development environment for Designate,
using BIND9 as the DNS backend and MySQL as the storage backend. For a more complete discussion on
installation & configuration options, please see :ref:`architecture`.

For this guide you will need access to an Ubuntu Server (16.04).

.. _Development Environment:

Development Environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Installing Designate
====================

.. index::
   double: install; designate

1. Install system package dependencies (Ubuntu)

::

   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo apt install -y python-pip python-virtualenv libssl-dev libffi-dev git
   $ sudo apt build-dep -y python-lxml

2. Clone the Designate repo

::

   $ mkdir openstack
   $ cd openstack
   $ git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack/designate.git
   $ cd designate


3. Setup a virtualenv

.. note::
   This step is necessary to allow the installation of an up-to-date
   pip, independent of the version packaged for Ubuntu. it is
   also useful in isolating the remainder of Designate's dependencies
   from the rest of the system.

::

   $ virtualenv .venv
   $ . .venv/bin/activate

4. Install an up-to-date pip

::

   $ pip install -U pip


5. Install Designate and its dependencies

::

   $ pip install -e .


6. Change directories to the etc/designate folder.

.. note::
    Everything from here on out should take place in or below your designate/etc folder

::

   $ cd etc/designate


7. Create Designate's config files by copying the sample config files

::

   $ cp -a rootwrap.conf.sample rootwrap.conf


8. Make the directory for Designate’s state files

::

   $ mkdir -p ../../state


Configuring Designate
======================

.. index::
    double: configure; designate

Create the designate.conf file

::

  $ editor designate.conf


Copy or mirror the configuration from this sample file here:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/basic-config-sample.conf
    :language: ini


Installing RabbitMQ
===================

Install the RabbitMQ package

::

    $ sudo apt install -y rabbitmq-server

Create a user:

::

    $ sudo rabbitmqctl add_user designate designate

Give the user access to the / vhost:

::

    $ sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p "/" designate ".*" ".*" ".*"


Installing MySQL
================

.. index::
    double: install; mysql

Install the MySQL server package

::

    $ sudo apt install -y mysql-server


If you do not have MySQL previously installed, you will be prompted to change the root password.
By default, the MySQL root password for Designate is "password". You can:

* Change the root password to "password"
* If you want your own password, edit the designate.conf file and change any instance of
   "mysql+pymysql://root:password@127.0.0.1/designate?charset=utf8" to "mysql+pymysql://root:YOUR_PASSWORD@127.0.0.1/designate?charset=utf8"

You can change your MySQL password anytime with the following command::

    $ mysqladmin -u root -p password NEW_PASSWORD
    Enter password <enter your old password>

Create the Designate tables

::

    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password: <enter your password here>

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE `designate` CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    mysql> exit;


Install additional packages

::

    $ sudo apt install -y libmysqlclient-dev
    $ pip install pymysql


Installing BIND9
================

.. index::
    double: install; bind9

Install the DNS server, BIND9

::

    $ sudo apt install -y bind9

Update the BIND9 Configuration

::

    $ sudo editor /etc/bind/named.conf.options

Change the corresponding lines in the config file:

::

    options {
      directory "/var/cache/bind";
      dnssec-validation auto;
      auth-nxdomain no; # conform to RFC1035
      listen-on-v6 { any; };
      allow-new-zones yes;
      request-ixfr no;
      recursion no;
    };

Disable AppArmor for BIND9

::

    $ sudo touch /etc/apparmor.d/disable/usr.sbin.named
    $ sudo systemctl reload apparmor

Restart BIND9:

::

    $ sudo systemctl restart bind9

Create and Import pools.yaml File
=================================

.. index::
   double: install; pools

Create the pools.yaml file

::

  $ editor pools.yaml

Copy or mirror the configuration from this sample file here:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/basic-pools-sample.yaml
    :language: yaml

Initialize the Database
=======================

.. index::
   double: install; database

Sync the Designate database.

::

   $ designate-manage database sync

Start the Central Service
=========================

.. index::
   double: install; central


Start the central service.

::

   $ designate-central


You'll now be seeing the log from the central service.


Initialize Pools Information
============================

Import the pools.yaml file into Designate. It is important that
``designate-central`` is started before invoking this command

::

   $ designate-manage pool update --file pools.yaml


Start the other Services
========================

.. index::
   double: install; services

Open up some new ssh windows and log in to your server (or open some new screen/tmux sessions).

::

   $ cd openstack/designate
   $ source .venv/bin/activate

Start the other services

::

   $ designate-api
   $ designate-mdns
   $ designate-worker
   $ designate-producer

You’ll now be seeing the logs from the other services.

Exercising the API
==================

.. note:: If you have a firewall enabled, make sure to open port 53, as well as Designate's default port (9001).

Using a web browser, curl statement, or a REST client, calls can be made to the
Designate API. You can find the various API calls on the api-ref_ document.

For example:

::

   $ curl 127.0.0.1:9001/v2/zones -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '
     {
       "name": "example.com.",
       "email": "example@example.com"
     }'

   {"status": "PENDING",.....
   $ curl 127.0.0.1:9001/v2/zones
   {"zones": [{"status": "ACTIVE",.....

The ``ACTIVE`` status shows that the zone propagated. So you should be able to perform a DNS query and
see it:

::

    $ dig @127.0.0.1 example.com SOA +short
    ns1-1.example.org. example.example.com. 1487884120 3531 600 86400 3600

You can find the IP Address of your server by running

::

   ip addr show eth0 | grep "inet\b" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1

If you have Keystone set up, you can use it by configuring the ``[keystone_authtoken]`` section and changing
the ``auth_strategy = keystone`` in the ``service:api`` section. This will make it easier to use clients
like the ``openstack`` CLI that expect Keystone.
