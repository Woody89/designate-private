==============================
Upgrading to Ocata from Newton
==============================

Upgrading Code and Enabling Services
------------------------------------

1. Deploy Ocata code or packages.
2. Restart all services. See the Newton upgrade guide for enabling
   ``designate-producer`` and ``designate-worker``.

New Features
------------

- The notifications Designate emits via MQ are now pluggable, drivers are
  defined by python entrypoints and the new ``notification_plugin`` option
  in the ``DEFAULT`` config section enables selection. By default, the
  notifications have not changed. There is an ``audit`` plugin that can
  be used, if desired.

- Scheduling zones across pools. See these
  `docs <https://docs.openstack.org/developer/designate/pool-scheduler.html>`_
  for more details.

Deprecation Notices
-------------------

- ``designate-zone-manager`` and ``designate-pool-manager`` remain deprecated
  and will be removed in a future release.
