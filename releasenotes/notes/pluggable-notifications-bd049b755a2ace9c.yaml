features:
  - Operators now have a choice in the type of notification payload
    content that Designate can emit via oslo.messaging's Notifier.
    
    The default plugin is configured to emit the same information
    that the notifications previous to this patch emitted. So there
    is no functional change.

    Operators can write their own notification plugins that exist
    in designate/notifications.py.

    An "audit" plugin is included. This plugin emits object changes,
    if they exist, along with zone ids, zone/recordset names.

    A plugin can define multiple payloads from a single notification
    to be emitted at once, if desirable.

    The selection of a plugin is defined by python entrypoints (for
    driver availability) and the new "notification_plugin" option
    in the "DEFAULT" config section.
